# shoutengai

*Your one-stop shop for Reactive Play Store Billing!*

## What?

[Shoutengai (商店街)][1] literally means something like "store street,"
and is often a long street, or series of streets, filled with small
shops and things in Japan.

## No, but seriously, what?

Shoutengai is a lightweight [RxJava2][2] wrapper on top of the
[Play Billing Library][3]. It may be functional in its current form,
but it's also still very early days so "buyer beware."
